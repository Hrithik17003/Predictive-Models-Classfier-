# Predictive-Models-Classfier-
Greetings,
I will be taking up  project and simultaneously I will keep adding them here.
I will be adding the details of dataset and refer them here itself.

A] Predicting Parkinson's Disease : 
Data set : https://data.world/uci/parkinsons 
In the code file, I have used KNN, SVM, Binary Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Decision Tree.
At the end of the code file, one can find the table with algorithms used and its accuracy.
I have also tried to tune the model and mentioned the same in my code file.


B] Forest Fire Prediction: 
Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/surya635/forest-fire-prediction?select=covtype.csv
In the code file, I have used Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost and XGBoost classifiers.
At the end of the code file, one can find the table with algorithms used and its accuracy.
